		<p>Review - This is by far the cutest place I've seen in Mandalay. But cakes are a bit pricy but taste good. I can say like their cakes are best in taste as far as I had tried in Mandalay. On top of that, it's fantastic coffee. I am picky and had to keep myself from ordering a 3rd flat white because it was so good. The dessert is also really good. The menu is small, but the food was good, The decor is perfect; it's clean; and the music is not too loud..... all things I like in a cafe. And they even sell birthday cake. They often make weekend special for Croissant.</p>
